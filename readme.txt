This plugin enables Google adsense display on the sidebar or widget area only by activating and configuring the widget.

== Description ==

Amikelive Adsense Widget was originally Google Adsense Sidebar Widget accessible at [Amikelive Tech](http://tech.amikelive.com "Amikelive Tech")
that has been rewritten to comply with Wordpress 2.8 coding style.

Wordpress users who want to display Google Adsense on the sidebar or widget area of their blogs without much hassle can use this plugin. 
Only by configuring the plugin through the widget interface, everything is ready to rock and you will just wait for some ad revenue to flow
into your wallet.

This plugin is licensed under GPLv2.

== Installation ==

1. Unzip the archive and upload the folder to the '/wp-content/plugins' directory.

2. Activate the plugin from the "Plugins" menu in Wordpress admin panel.

3. Click "Appearance" menu and choose "Widgets". Find "Amikelive Adsense Widget" in the "Available Widgets" section.

4. Drag the widget to the sidebar or widget area (in Wordpress 3.0) of your choice.

5. Expand the widget to see the configuration fields by clicking the arrow located at the right side.

6. Fill the configuration field with your adsense parameters. You can get these parameters from the code of an ad unit generated 
   under Manage Ads menu in your Google Adsense administration panel.
   The reference of the Adsense parameter and its respected configuration field in this plugin can be seen below:
   * Adsense Client ID -> google_ad_client
   * Adsense Slot Number -> google_ad_slot
   * Adsense Width -> google_ad_width
   * Adsense Height -> google_ad_height

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

What is the difference between this version and the one hosted on [tech.amikelive.com](http://tech.amikelive.com/node-330/a-simple-adsense-sidebar-widget-for-wordpress/ "Adsense widget on Amikelive Tech")?

The version hosted on the Wordpress site will be the most up-to-date version of the plugin.

Why don't you create an easier way to insert the Adsense parameters in the widget?

This will be addressed in a future release that will enable tracking and simpler configuration.
